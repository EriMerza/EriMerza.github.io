        <!--Paragraphs Placehold-->
        <p>This is a paragraph that talks about myself. It goes on and on to tell you all these really cool things about who I am and what I do. Listen to me babble on about my schooling and career. Did you know I'm one of less than ~40% of Americans with a BA Degree? Yup. I can walk backwards too but that's not as uncommon as the degree.</p>
        <p>Then in a whole new paragraph I start to babble on about my goals and things I want to accomplish in the future. Wow. Can I talk. Er, write. Did I mention all those cool helpful skills that I mastered? I put them on my resume so I look smart. Maybe give me a job or take a look around my page and think about how awesome I'd be at your comapny. Keep reading and learning more and more about me. Wow. I bet you didn't know all of this. How neat. Neat-o! </p>
